# Contract Creators

Anyone who has NEP tokens can create a cover contract. To avoid spam, questionable, and confusing cover contracts, a creator has to burn 1000 NEP tokens. Additionally, the contract creator also needs to stake 4000 NEP tokens or more. The higher the sake, the more visibility the contract gets if there are multiple cover contracts with the same name or similar terms.

## Rewards

The contract creator will earn a steady income of 1% of all cover fees paid by the users. Initial contract creators will also earn additional 1% of the cover fees in NEP.

This added NEP reward comes from the Protocol Incentives allocation, as described in our token design.

### About Reporting Questionable or Invalid Contracts

The governance system allows NEP tokenholders to vote to invalidate and remove any cover contract.

* The staked NEP tokens of the contract creator will be burned.
* The users having non-expired covers can withdraw their cover fee.
* The liquidity providers can withdraw their staked NEP tokens, stablecoins, and cover fees.
