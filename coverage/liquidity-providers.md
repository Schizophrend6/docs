# Liquidity Providers

The liquidity providers can evaluate a cover contract and ensure that it is up to their satisfaction. One can then provide liquidity in BUSD or other supported cryptocurrency. A liquidity provider needs to also stake 250 NEP or higher.

## Farming Strategy

To maximize return on investment, 25% of the idle/uncovered assets in the liquidity pool is supplied to [Venus Protocol](https://venus.io/) for lending. The interest received on loan is capitalized back into the liquidity pool, shared amongst all liquidity providers. The platform will deduct 2% of the profit generated to purchase \(and burn\) NEP tokens from decentralized exchange\(s\).

This feature will be available starting from the Neptune Mutual Protocol v2.

## Cover Fees

The liquidity providers collectively earn cover fees paid by the platform users. Initial liquidity provider will receive additional 10% rewards in NEP tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
This added NEP reward comes from the Protocol Incentives allocation, as described in our token design.
