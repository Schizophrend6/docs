# How Does a Bond Work?

Select a cryptocurrency to participate in the NEP bond pool which not only generates the following rewards but you will also get all of the liquidity pool fee earned in the PancakeSwap exchange. Furthermore, you can also provide the LP tokens to earn additional rewards in the NEP farms once your LP tokens are released after the locking period.

> There is a limited amount of NEP tokens that are allocated to be distributed to the community under "Liquidity Pool Rewards" allocation in our token design. Unlike most DeFi projects with a continuous token minting model, NEP tokens are finite and deflationary. As a consequence, both Bond and Pool features will be completed \(ended\) as soon as the target amount of NEP distribution completes.

Before you proceed, read and understand the [risks factors](https://docs.neptunemutual.com/app/usage/risk-factors) involved.

Once your transaction completes, click on the "**Bond Button"** which will open up a new modal window.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

Enter the amount of the bond liquidity token you wish to bond or simply stake, click on the "Max" button if you want to specify the maximum value that you can stake. Note that an approximate bond amount in NEP is displayed in the UI. The final bond amount \(after smart contract interaction\) will be your reward.

The platform will also display the date and time when your bond is going to be released. It is not possible to withdraw your bond before that timestamp. Carefully examine all the details and then click "**Confirm Button"** to proceed.
