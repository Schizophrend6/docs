# Bond Introduction

Early Neptune Mutual platform users can benefit from the NEP bond pool by locking their cryptocurrency to create liquidity pairs in PancakeSwap Exchange. After the specified lockup period, you can withdraw your initial token with the addition of an equivalent amount in the NEP token. You do not have to purchase NEP and neither are you exchanging your cryptocurrency for NEP tokens.
