# Moderation Panel

Telegram moderation panel is a small group of both team members and collaborators from the community who have earned our trust. The telegram moderation panel handles nontechnical code of conduct violations, has access to community moderation tools, and helps keep our community motivated, safe, and positive.

Any individual moderation board member identity, unless one explicitly shares by their own free will, must be kept strictly confidential. All moderators must respect others' wishes for privacy. Failing to do so will result in losing your moderation rights. Any request to violate any individual's privacy will not only be ignored but can also result in warnings or a ban by our moderation panel.
