## What is Neptune Mutual?

Neptune Mutual is a decentralized finance project in Binance Smart Chain, mainly focusing on Coverage and Prediction Market. To create initial demand and incentivize early adopters, Neptune Mutual launched liquidity-mining features like Bond and Farm Pool.

## How Does the NEP Bond Pool Work?

You specify the amount of cryptocurrency to stake in the pool while the pool adds the equivalent amount of NEP \(on your behalf\) to form a liquidity pair on PancakeSwap Exchange. Your cryptocurrency will be locked for 90 days or as suggested in the user interface. After the locking period, you receive your tokens back \(minus fees\) with additional NEP tokens received as the liquidity pool reward.

## How Does the NEP \(Farm\) Pool Work?

Select a cryptocurrency, liquidity token, or NEP your wish to stake in the NEP Pool. You stake or lock your "liquidity tokens" to receive NEP as the liquidity pool reward. There is a minimum lock period of 24 hours before you can unstake your liquidity.

## Will the Bond and Pool Close in the Future? 

Yes. Both bond and farm pool smart contracts are written in such a way that they automatically end as soon as the maximum amount of "liquidity token" is staked.

## When Will the Bond and Pool Reopen Again?

If the bond or pool still has unspent NEP reward balance and if the maximum amount of "liquidity token" comes down when people unstake, you will then be able to deposit more. These parameters are specified in the smart contracts and can be publicly viewed. Read the smart contract documentation pages to understand how to check these parameters live in the blockchain.

## Who is behind Neptune Mutual?

The team behind Neptune Mutual has chosen to remain anonymous.

## Can I Become a Contributor?

Of course. Check out our [Contributor Application page](https://docs.neptunemutual.com/app/community/apply-to-contribute) for more info.

## Does the NEP Token Have Continuous Emission?

No, it doesn't. There is a fixed supply of NEP tokens. The maximum supply of the NEP token is 225M NEP before distribution.

## Is the NEP Token Deflationary?

Yes. The NEP tokens go out of circulation when they are staked \(temporary\) and burned \(permanent\).

**Staking**

* Staking NEP tokens for governance
* Staking NEP tokens to provide liquidity and earning rewards
* Staking NEP tokens to become coverage reporter
* Staking NEP tokens to create a new coverage market
* Staking NEP tokens to create a new prediction market

**Burning System**

* Creating a new coverage pool requires you to burn 1000 NEP tokens. Coverage creators will earn a small portion of the coverage fees collected in BUSD or BNB.
* 4000 NEP tokens must be staked when creating a coverage pool. The higher your stake, the more visibility your coverage will get in the market.
* Coverage pools are available in BUSD. We deduct 6.5% of the coverage fee or coverage claim in BUSD or BNB. The acquired BUSD will be used to purchase NEP tokens in the PancakeSwap exchange and then immediately burned in a single transaction.
* Providing liquidity to a coverage pool requires you to stake 250 NEP or higher.
* Creating a new prediction market requires you to burn 250 NEP tokens.
* The NEP tokens must be staked when creating a prediction market. The higher your stake, the more visibility your prediction will get in the market. Dishonest market makers lose all of their staked tokens if they try to cheat.
* Prediction markets are available in BUSD \(and later BNB\) and also earn \(%tbd\) platform commission fees in BUSD. The fee settlement event will automatically trigger NEP/BUSD \(or another pair\) purchase on PancakeSwap. On the same transaction, the NEP tokens acquired via this automated process will be immediately burned.
* Prediction market dispute resolution will result in a token burn for those who vote against the majority.

The suggested amount of NEP tokens to burn and/or stake is for information purpose only. Please be advised that these amounts are configurable and can change now or in the future.

## What Is the List of Exchanges That Will Be Covered?

The Neptune Mutual platform allows any NEP holder to create a cover contract. A creator needs to burn 1000 NEP tokens to create a new cover contract. To prevent fraudulent contracts, the creator is required to lock 4000 NEP or more. The cover creator will earn a percentage of the fees \(in BUSD\) collected in the contract.

## How Can I Earn in the Cover Pool? What Are the Benefits?

In order for you to join a coverage pool as a liquidity provider, you need to stake 250 NEP or higher and supply BUSD liquidity in the pool. You will earn your proportional stake of cover fees earned every month. The protocol deducts 6.5% of the total cover fees and then transfer it back to the pool. This automatically compounds your liquidity in the pool for higher returns.

{% hint style="info" %}
To encourage more people to join the cover pool, the protocol will airdrop NEP tokens to the initial liquidity providers on top of the cover fees. This will be stopped when we run out of NEP reward allocation.
{% endhint %}

The fee deducted by the platform will initiate a swap transaction in the PancakeSwap Exchange and the received NEP tokens will be burned in a single transaction.
