To prevent such damages, most of our smart contracts have a Recovery mechanism. That allows our admins to withdraw accidentally sent BNB and BEP-20 tokens.

Rest assured, if the Neptune Mutual team can recover the funds, we will send it back to the original address it came from--however big or small the amount. To prevent spam requests, we may ask you to deposit a transaction fee to cover the transfer.
