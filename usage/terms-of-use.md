# Terms of Use

Neptune Mutual Project distributed the Neptune Mutual Protocol under Business Source License 1.1. While our code is in part available to download, review, and improve under open-source and source-available software licenses, none of our licenses include a license to use our trademarks. Proper use of our trademarks is essential to inform users whether or not Neptune Mutual Project stands behind a product or service. When using Neptune Mutual Project trademarks, you must comply with these Neptune Mutual Project Trademark Guidelines. Just like other projects that develop open-source software, we must enforce our trademark rights to protect our users.

### Acceptable Uses

You may do the following without receiving specific permission from Neptune Mutual Project:

* Use Neptune Mutual Project wordmarks and logo in the text to truthfully refer to and/or link to unmodified Neptune Mutual smart contracts, protocols, interfaces, programs, products, services, and technologies \(”Neptune Mutual software”\).
* Use the Neptune Mutual Project wordmarks to truthfully describe modified versions of Neptune Mutual software that you may create or make available. For example, you may say ”This software is derived from Neptune Mutual software.” or ”This service uses software derived from Neptune Mutual software.”
* Use the Neptune Mutual Project logo in software or aggregators that integrate with Neptune Mutual software to truthfully refer to, and, where possible, link to the applicable Neptune Mutual software feature hosted on the blockchain.
* Use Neptune Mutual Project wordmarks to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by Neptune Mutual Project.
* Follow the terms of the open-source licenses for Neptune Mutual software.

### When allowed, how can I use a Neptune Mutual Project trademark?

* You must include a trademark attribution notice at the first or most prominent mention of the mark on a webpage, document, or documentation, such as: ”\[Neptune Mutual Project trademark\] is a trademark of Neptune Mutual Project.”
* You may not change the logo except to scale it. If the logo is used, you must give the Neptune Mutual Project logo adequate spacing from the other elements on the webpage or document to ensure legibility and reduce the likelihood of confusion.
* You must always use the wordmarks in their exact form and with the correct spelling, neither abbreviated nor hyphenated nor combined with any other word or words.
* You must always use the Neptune Mutual Project wordmarks only as an adjective, never as a noun or verb, or in plural or possessive forms.
  * Instead, use the generic term for the Neptune Mutual product or service following the trademark.
  * For example Neptune Mutual Protocol, Neptune Mutual interface, Neptune Mutual website.
